This project contains the basic setup needed to get Django running on Google App Engine with a few changes.

For Django-nonrel instructions visit the website:

The few changes that I've made include the following:

1. I've followed the Django-nonrel installation instructions and also zipped all of the Django-nonrel dependencies and modified main.py to add the zip files to the path.

2. I also moved the django admin media and templates into the media and templates directories (respectively). This was necessary because django's source is zipped.
